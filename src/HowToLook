BEST WAY TO LOOK AND REVISE THE PROJECT >
1.SEARCHBAR.JSX
2.APP.JSX
3.TASKLIST.JSX
4.TASK.JSX

This time i added the tick mark at the left of each task therefore i made the task string into an object with a completed feature that will tell if it is completed or not , called the completed function in task.jsx , tasklist.jsx and wrote it in app.jsx

HOW WE ADDED A CARD ON CLICK THAT SHOWS ADDED AND DEADLINE IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND , I AM STILL NOT GETTING IT
